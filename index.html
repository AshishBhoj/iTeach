                <p class="section-subtag text-small">Do you ever feel like your study habits simply aren’t cutting it?
                    Do
                    you wonder what you could be doing to perform better in class and on exams? Many students realize
                    that
                    their high school study habits aren’t very effective in college. This is understandable, as college
                    is
                    quite different from high school. The professors are less personally involved, classes are bigger,
                    exams
                    are worth more, reading is more intense, and classes are much more rigorous. That doesn’t mean
                    there’s
                    anything wrong with you; it just means you need to learn some more effective study skills.
                    Fortunately,
                    there are many active, effective study strategies that are shown to be effective in college classes.

                    This handout offers several tips on effective studying. Implementing these tips into your regular
                    study
                    routine will help you to efficiently and effectively learn course material. Experiment with them and
                    find some that work for you. Simply reading and re-reading texts or notes is not actively engaging
                    in
                    the material. It is simply re-reading your notes. Only ‘doing’ the readings for class is not
                    studying.
                    It is simply doing the reading for class. Re-reading leads to quick forgetting. Try to do something
                    for
                    each class each day. Be specific and realistic regarding how long you plan to spend on each task—you
                    should not have more tasks on your list than you can reasonably complete during the day.</p>

                <p class="section-subtag text-small">One of the most impactful learning strategies is “distributed
                    practice”spacing out your studying over several short periods of time over several days and weeks.
                    The
                    most effective practice is to work a short time on each class every day. The total amount of time
                    spent
                    studying will be the same (or less) than one or two marathon library sessions, but you will learn
                    the
                    information more deeply and retain much more for the long term—which will help get you an A on the
                    final. The important thing is how you use your study time, not how long you study. Long study
                    sessions
                    lead to a lack of concentration and thus a lack of learning and retention. In order to spread out
                    studying over short periods of time across several days and weeks, you need control over your
                    schedule.
                    Keeping a list of tasks to complete on a daily basis will help you to include regular active
                    studying
                    sessions for each class.</p>
